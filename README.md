# Filed: A Blog for the History of Paperwork #


To my knowledge, there is no blog of such kind out there yet. Yet, historical scholarship in the field of history of (bureaucratic) 
paperwork has been gathering momentum over the past 10 years or so. Following a number of dispersed scholarly publications, Ben Kafka, in a 
2009 literature review for [Book History]() was first to suggest to gather this scholarship under the label of what 
he coined **"the history of paperwork"**

Since 2016, I have been carving out my niche in this scholarly field and promoting/gathering scholarship on twitter under the *#histpaperwork*, 
viz. short for 'history of paperwork'. 


A colleague with whom I have been exchanging ideas about my blog idea, following my initiative, started to gather resources 
for a similar project entitled [Literature & Bureaucracy from Shakespeare to Kafka](https://twitter.com/DerekVindice/status/1259782834409164800).

There are similarities
His project has great potential and I am excited to see what comes of it. 
yet his project is meant to develop into a research network comprising conferences and other forms of academic collaborations, and as far as I am 
aware to date there is no plan to add a blog to this endeavour.

Focus is clearly on an earlier period than mine, namely Renaissance/early modern period and is concerned more specifically with 
"literature's response and/or resistance to the growth of bureaucracy", as is mentioned in Derek's initial [call](https://twitter.com/DerekVindice/status/1259782834409164800/photo/1)


## UX ##

I sent out a [first call for contributors](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1255194721208741890) on 28 April in form of a twitter thread, stating my main ideas 
for this blog encouraging my 'followers' to spread the word and send their statements of interest to me via email. 


Response to my tweet was overhwlemingly positive, across the ranks of the scholarly community. Currently, two 
colleagues - [James Purdon](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/english/people/jjp5) and [Chris A. Williams](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/caw322) - have 
comitted to the cause and we are currently in the process of dividing responsibilities and assigning roles (co-editors and/or advisors).
We also agreed that the editing and advisory team needs to be much more inclusive and diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity 
This was followed by a similar, [second call](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1279396434635370496) on July 4 to which I added a 
google [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7NhSFTwzLrkMulq3ERP6cURSmIDVFvC7GLSbo_qzNQ/edit#gid=0) asking 
contributors to add name, institutional affiliation and their ideas for this blog. My tweet this time rectified a significant oversight in my first call and now 
explicitly addressed my policy of inclusion and diversity, partly in response to an all male, all-white response to my first call. 



In response to my call on April 28th, I also received a number of 
suggestions from colleagues of how to improve on the initial ideas and what else to include such as a reading list/bibliography 
and names of potential candidates

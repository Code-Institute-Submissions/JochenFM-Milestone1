## UX ##

I tweeted out a [first call for contributors](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1255194721208741890) on 28 April in form of a thread, stating my main ideas 
for this blog encouraging my 'followers' to spread the word and send their statements of interest to me via email. 
This was followed by a similar, [second call](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1279396434635370496) on July 4 to which I added a 
google [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7NhSFTwzLrkMulq3ERP6cURSmIDVFvC7GLSbo_qzNQ/edit#gid=0) asking 
contributors to add name, institutional affiliation and their ideas for this blog. My tweet this time rectified a huge oversight in my first call and now 
explicitly addressed my policy of inclusion and diversity, partly in response to an all male, all-white response to my first call. 




## Features ##

### Features left to implement ###
-	I am hoping to wire up the submit form on the contribute site to a JavaScript email API/ to an external email interface.
-	A ‘search’ form and ‘search’ button on the right hand sight of the navbar, probably taken from Bootstrap and customized further
-	A searchable database for all the posts, by keywords
-	Create facebook and twitter accounts and put links in footer live
-	Add more content

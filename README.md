# FILED: A Blog for the History of Paperwork #

This project brings together for the first time scholarship on paperwork – all documents produced in response to a demand (real or imagined) by 
an office, the law, a lab, or similar organizational entity - and aims to develop into a collaborative, international, 
and peer-reviewed blog. 

comprising technologies that now have become the iconic repertoire from which graphical computer interfaces are assembled: forms, manila folder, keyboard, filing cabinet etc  as not least this blog tesitifies.
I envision this to be less about topics covered by art & literary history 
oriented toward practical, rather than literary ends

focus should be on 19th/20th mass-scale information systems in 

The main aims of this blog are:

* get people inside and outside academia thinking about paperwork in the past and in the present;

* bring together scholarship and facilitate deeper discussions among librarians, historians, curators, & archivists 
around all aspects of pre-electric data management & material cultures involved;

* help consolidate history of paperwork as an identifiable subfield within historical scholarship.


 prepare larger funding bid

Following a number of dispersed publications, historical scholarship in the field of history of (bureaucratic) 
paperwork has been gathering momentum over the past 10 years or so, and so has academic blogging in History, shifting from a sort of hobby to a professional and potentially 
highly rewarding activity giving current historical scholarship an accessible public face. This blog brings together both - the history of paperwork and blogging -


 





## UX ##

Cultural historian [Ben Kafka](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ben-kafka), in a 2009 literature review for [Book History](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40930549?seq=1), 
was first to suggest to gather dispersed scholarship under the label of **"the history of paperwork"**. Since 2016, I have been carving out my 
niche in this scholarly field and promoted scholarship on twitter under the *#histpaperwork* hashtag, viz. short for 'history of paperwork'. So the idea for this 
blog predates my enrolment at CI, yet upon studying the course material I have carried with me the idea of using Milestone Project 1 to have a first shot
at implementing it. 
To my knowledge, there is no blog of such kind out there yet. Derek Dunne, a colleague with whom I have been exchanging ideas about my blog in May, started to gather resources 
for a similar project entitled [Literature & Bureaucracy from Shakespeare to Kafka](https://twitter.com/DerekVindice/status/1259782834409164800). 

There are similarities between his project and mine and I am excited to see what comes of his, yet his project is first and foremost designed as a 
research network comprising conferences and other forms of academic collaborations, and, as far as I am 
aware, there is no plan to add a blog to this endeavour.

Also, his project is more specifically concerned with "literature's response and/or resistance to 
the growth of bureaucracy", as is mentioned in Derek's initial [call](https://twitter.com/DerekVindice/status/1259782834409164800/photo/1) and focuses on 
an earlier period than mine, namely Renaissance/early modern period (pre-1700). 


In terms of blog title (and future URL), I first opted for "Notes on Paper: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" and "Paper Tales: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" which both nicely 
capture my main idea of writing and editing tales about paper for a broader readership inside and outside the academy. A third option was "Paper Trails: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" - beautifully 
encapsulating in the title one of the main functions of paperwork which is also a concern here: the seriality of written documents, especially when it comes to documenting 
re-occuring events or activities of an organization.   
A quick search on google quickly showed, however, that all three titles (URLs) had been taken up already for varying purposes and audiences.

[Notes on Paper](http://notesonpaper.blogspot.com/) is a personal blog, while 'Paper Tales' is used by a number of blogs on paper art and craft, such as [My Paper Tales](http://mypapertales.blogspot.com/), [Paper Tales](https://www.papertales.co.za/), 
and [Paper Tales](http://www.papertales.com/) \[sic!\]

'Paper trails', on the other hand, has been used as a title for an ongoing scholarly 
[publication project](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/special-collections/2019/08/23/call-for-papers-for-paper-trails-a-new-open-access-publication-with-ucl-press/) at University College London,
and is the product name of a cloud-hosted [log management system](https://www.papertrail.com/).

In the face of such rather crowded online space, I decided to go with "Filed: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" instead. 
The reference to 'files' in the title is not a bad choice in the end, as it allows us to immediately point readership to the main focus of this blog: the file in its more standardized formats as 
arguably the most basic unit of paperwork - an idea which neither 'paper tales' nor 'paper trails' convey in the same manner, 
as can be seen from the above-mentioned usage for paper art and craft. 

In preparation for this project, I sent out a [first call for contributors](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1255194721208741890) on 28 April in form of a twitter thread, stating my main ideas 
for this blog encouraging my 'followers' to spread the word and send their statements of interest to me via email. 

I had not heard much at this time of the UX process, but I expect different user groups to have the following expectations when they come to the site for the first time: 

* As a reader outside the academy, I want to be informed on the topic, especially on how its historical instances tie in with present-day issues 
related to inscriptions, reading, power, and information so that I can become a more responsible and critical citizen;
* As an archivist, museum curator, or historian I want to share my knowledge about files and filing and enter conversation with the respective other professional groups who each have their own blind spots;
* As a contributor, I want to know where I can submit my post safely and securly so I can partake in the widest possible dissemination of my work to foster historical research and debate;  
* As a contributor, I wish to grow my academic network so that I know more about what is being done in the field and know where and how I can contribute to the debates;
* As any of the above user groups, I want this site to look credible and trustworthy;
* As any of the above user groups, I want to quickly find my way around this site, and also know fast how I can contact the relevant editors;
* As any of the above user groups, I want to learn more about the aims and rationale of this blog and its main focus.





Response to my call of April 28 was overhwlemingly positive, across the ranks of the scholarly community. I also received a number of 
suggestions from colleagues of how to improve on the initial ideas and who/what else to include in this blog, such as a bibliography to gather pertinent literature 
in one place online. Recuitment is still ongoing but, currently two colleagues - [James Purdon](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/english/people/jjp5) and [Chris A. Williams](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/caw322) - have 
comitted to the cause and we are currently in the process of dividing responsibilities and assigning roles (as co-editors, reviewers, and/or advisors).
We also agreed that the editing and advisory team needs to be more inclusive and diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity in response to which I launched a 
[second call](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1279396434635370496) on July 4 recitifying this significant oversight in my first call by explicitly addressing 
work by scholars and activists of non-white and post-colonial background. I also added a 
google [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7NhSFTwzLrkMulq3ERP6cURSmIDVFvC7GLSbo_qzNQ/edit#gid=0) asking potential
contributors to fill in  name, institutional affiliation and their ideas for this blog. 



I subsequently sketched out the wireframes, first by hand, as can be seen from this photo of the index.html page (a PDF with all hand-sketched wireframes combined 
can be accessed via the directory on the left under *wireframes/handsketched_combined.pdf*).

![Hand-sketched](wireframes/home_handdrawn.jpeg). 



The digital wireframes were done by Balsamiq and look as follows:



![Balsamiq wireframe](wireframes/home.png) 
![Balsamiq wireframes](wireframes/about.png)
![Balsamiq wireframes](wireframes/writeus.png)





As can be seen from the depiction, fonts, colours, and design choices at that stage were all pretty limited, but the main design choices than can now be found on this site had been mande.
 
My design was primarily inspired by the feasibility based on what we had learned in the three modules thus far, and the desire to recreate the design world of the early 20th-century
bureau 

This may be a sterotype, but historians are almost always in the mood to read so I did not refrain from larger paragraphs of text - this is a history blog after all,
designed to gather and disseminate mostly textual information on a text-heavy topic.

### Features left to implement ###

Additional features to be implemented in the coming weeks include:

- [ ] wire up the submit form on contributions.html to an external email interface to be able to receive emails and attachments which will be essential to the purpose of this site.
- [ ] insert ‘search’ form and ‘search’ button on the right hand sight of the navbar, probably taken from Bootstrap and customized further, combined with a searchable database of all posts	
- [ ] create facebook and twitter accounts and put links in footer live
- [ ] add more substantial content as indicated in navbar under 'Ressources' and, for instance, by inserting more links in about.html directing to 
    institutional affiliations of and publications by editors and advisors.
- [ ] ask artist to join and design fitting graphic templates that can be used across the blog
- [ ] a carousel of images at the top of index.html as done [here](notchesblog.com) or [here](blackcentraleurope.com);
- [ ] a highly visible box or card with contact details for more general queries which are not article submissions
- [ ] as and when more blog entries will have been posted, I envision to increase the categories under which they are archived (and searchable) beyond the current one of "recent posts"
such as by geographical region, historial period, and theme. 
- [ ] expand on the submission form as done [here](http://notchesblog.com/write-for-notches/), for instance, and also insert further specifications of sunmission guidelines in terms of word count, aims, scope and style. 
- [ ] add tooltip from Bootstrap to Data Protection Policy tick box on 'contributions.html' with brief information what these are such as "At no time will we share your data with other 
    people or companies, the data provided will become part of the database of this blog exclusively..." and a link to more information on this which will be stored as a PDF or elsewhere.
- [ ] a comment function under each blog post for readers to share their views with added further data/comments policies.

# FILED: A Blog for the History of Paperwork #

This project comprises basic web content for a blog on the history of paperwork for the period 1800-1950. It aims to develop into a collaborative, international, 
and peer-reviewed blog that brings together for the first time scholarship on paperwork – all documents produced in response to a demand (real or imagined) by 
an office, the law, a lab, or similar organizational entity. 



Historical scholarship in the field of history of (bureaucratic) 
paperwork has been gathering momentum over the past 10 years or so. Following a number of dispersed scholarly publications, cultural historian 
[Ben Kafka](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ben-kafka), in a 2009 literature review for [Book History](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40930549?seq=1), was first to suggest to gather 
this scholarship under the label of **"the history of paperwork"**

aims to get people inside and outside the academy thinking about paperwork in the past and in the present


I envision this to be less about topics covered by art & literary history than to facilitate deeper discussions among librarians, historians, curators, & 
archivists around all aspects of pre-electric data management

oriented toward practical, rather than literary ends

focus should be on 19th/20th mass-scale information systems in
 comprising technologies that now have become the iconic repertoire from which graphical computer interfaces are assembled: forms, manila folder, keyboard, filing cabinets, 
 as not least this project tesitifies.


bringing together scholarship  // to facilitate deeper discussions among librarians, historians, curators, & archivists 
around all aspects of pre-electric data management & material cultures involved // to form research network and prepare larger funding bid // help consolidate history of paperwork as an identifiable subfield.

This process of professionalization—the shift from blogging as a hobby to a line on your CV—is not unique to Nursing Clio. Over the past several years, 
collaboratively produced history blogs have blossomed into popular venues that give current historical scholarship an accessible public face. They have grown rapidly, 
formalized their editorial procedures into those of small publications, and recruited new historians to join their ranks of writers and editors.

Apart from science communication, this blog will help contributors to habitualize their writing practices which is crucial for succesful science communication and ordering throughts  

## UX ##

 
Since 2016, I have been carving out my niche in this scholarly field of paperwork history and promoted scholarship on twitter under the *#histpaperwork* hashtag,
viz. short for 'history of paperwork'. So the idea for this blog predates my enrolment at CI, yet upon studying the course material I have carried with me the idea of using Milestone Project 1 to have a first shot
at implementing this idea. 



* As a historian,
* As a reader outside the academy, I want to be informed about historical scholarship to present-day issues related to inscriptions, reading, power, and information;
* As an archivist, I want to share my knowledge about files and filing with historians who often only read them without inquring about the process of their material production;
* As a contributor, I want to write down my throughts on regular basis so that I can order them and cut them up in publishable texts;
* As a early career historian, I want to get into the habit of writing regularly so that I can become a productive academic.

To my knowledge, there is no blog of such kind out there yet. Yet, Derek Dunne, a colleague with whom I have been exchanging ideas about my blog, started to gather resources 
for a similar project entitled [Literature & Bureaucracy from Shakespeare to Kafka](https://twitter.com/DerekVindice/status/1259782834409164800).

There are similarities
His project has great potential and I am excited to see what comes of it. 
yet his project is meant to develop into a research network comprising conferences and other forms of academic collaborations, and as far as I am 
aware to date there is no plan to add a blog to this endeavour.

Focus is clearly on an earlier period than mine, namely Renaissance/early modern period and is concerned more specifically with 
"literature's response and/or resistance to the growth of bureaucracy", as is mentioned in Derek's initial [call](https://twitter.com/DerekVindice/status/1259782834409164800/photo/1)

In terms of blog title (and future URL), I first opted for "Paper Tales: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" which nicely captures my main idea of writing tales about paper for
a broader readership inside and outside the academy. As second option was "Paper Trails: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" - again, beautifully encapsulating in the title one 
of the main functions of paperwork which is also a concern here: the seriality of written documents with regards to re-occuring events, especially with regards to activities of 
an organization.   
A quick search on google quickly showed, however, that both titles (URLs) had been taken up already, even although the target audience differed slightly:

A number of blogs on paper art and craft, such as [My Paper Tales](http://mypapertales.blogspot.com/), [Paper Tales](https://www.papertales.co.za/), 
and [Paper Tales](http://www.papertales.com/) \[sic!\]

'Paper trails', on the other hand, has been used as a title for an ongoing scholarly 
[publication project](https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/special-collections/2019/08/23/call-for-papers-for-paper-trails-a-new-open-access-publication-with-ucl-press/) at University College London,
and is the product name of a cloud-hosted [log management system](https://www.papertrail.com/).

In the face of such rather crowded online space, I decided to go with "Filed: A Blog for the History of Paperwork" instead. 
The reference to 'files' in the title is not a bad choice in the end, as it allows us to immediately point readership to the main focus of this blog: the file as 
arguably the most basic unit of paperwork in its more standardized formats - an idea which neither 'paper tales' nor 'paper trails' convey in the same manner, 
as can be seen from the above-mentioned usage for paper art and craft. 



In preparation for this project, I sent out a [first call for contributors](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1255194721208741890) on 28 April in form of a twitter thread, stating my main ideas 
for this blog encouraging my 'followers' to spread the word and send their statements of interest to me via email. 
Response to my tweet was overhwlemingly positive, across the ranks of the scholarly community. Currently, two 
colleagues - [James Purdon](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/english/people/jjp5) and [Chris A. Williams](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/caw322) - have 
comitted to the cause and we are currently in the process of dividing responsibilities and assigning roles (as co-editors, reviewers, and/or advisors).
We also agreed that the editing and advisory team needs to be more inclusive and diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity in response to which I launched a 
[second call](https://twitter.com/jochenfm/status/1279396434635370496) on July 4. I added a 
google [excel spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S7NhSFTwzLrkMulq3ERP6cURSmIDVFvC7GLSbo_qzNQ/edit#gid=0) asking potential
contributors to add name, institutional affiliation and their ideas for this blog. My tweet this time rectified a significant oversight in my first call and now 
explicitly addressed my policy of inclusion and diversity, partly in response to an all male, all-white response to my first call. 



In response to my call on April 28, I also received a number of 
suggestions from colleagues of how to improve on the initial ideas and what else to include in this blog, such as a bibliography to gather pertinent literature 
in one place online.





I subsequently sketched out the wireframes, first by hand as can be seen from this photo of the index.html page (a PDF with all hand-sketched wireframes combined 
can be accessed via the directory on the left under *wireframes/handsketched_combined.pdf*).

![Hand-sketched](wireframes/home_handdrawn.jpeg). 



 three Balsamiq wireframes:



![Balsamiq wireframe](wireframes/home.png) 
![Balsamiq wireframes](wireframes/about.png)
![Balsamiq wireframes](wireframes/writeus.png)





As can be seen above, fonts, colours, and design choices at that stage were all very limited only. 

My design was primarily inspired by the feasibility based on what we had learned in the three modules thus far, and the desire to recreate the design world of the early 20th-century
bureau 

This may be a sterotype, but historians are almost always in the mood to read so I did not refrain from larger paragraphs of text - this is a history blog after all,
designed to gather and disseminate mostly textual information on a text-heavy topic.

### Features left to implement ###

Additional features to be implemented in the coming weeks include:

- [ ] wire up the submit form on the 'write for us' site to an external email interface to be able to receive emails and attachments which will be essential to the purpose of this site.
- [ ]  ‘search’ form and ‘search’ button on the right hand sight of the navbar, probably taken from Bootstrap and customized further, combined with a searchable database of all posts	
- [ ] Create facebook and twitter accounts and put links in footer live
- [ ] Add more content as indicated in navbar under 'Ressources' and, for instance, by inserting more links in the 'About' section directing to 
    institutional affiliations of and publications by editors and advisors.
- [ ] ask artist to join and design fitting graphic templates that can be used across the blog
- [ ] a carousel of images at the top of 'home' as here notchesblog.com or blackcentraleurope.com
- [ ] a highly visible box or card with contact details for more general queries which are not article submissions
- [ ] as and when more blog entries will have been posted, I envision to increase the categories under which they are archived and searchable beyond the current one of "recent posts"
such as by geographical region, historial period, and theme. 
- [ ] expand on the submission form as here http://notchesblog.com/write-for-notches/ and also insert further specifications of sunmission guidelines in terms of aims, scope and style. 
- [ ] add tooltip from Bootstrap to Data Protection Policy tick box on 'contributions.html' with brief information what these are such as "At no time will we share your data with other 
    people or companies, the data provided will become part of the database of this blog exclusively..." and a link to more information on this which will be stored as a PDF or elsewhere.
- [ ] a comment function under each blog post for readers to share their views although this needs moderation and further data policies.

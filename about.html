                            <p> Jochen studied sociology and politics at universities in Berlin and Toulouse before completing his doctorate in history 
                            at the University of Edinburgh in 2012. He is an independent historian of 20th-century German state and public administration working at 
                            the interface between administrative history and the history of science and technology. He is currently preparing 
                            a book manuscript based on my PhD dissertation which takes the sprawling and (during Nazism) criminal labour administration 
                            as a case study to draw out some broader hypotheses on the relationships between state-building, information management, 
                            and bureaucratic authority from the late Weimar Republic, over the Nazi regime and Allied occupation, to 1960s West Germany. 
                            Working title is “Paper War: Office Work and the Government of Labour in Germany (1920-1960).”

                            <p> James Purdon studied English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, was a Herchel Smith scholar at 
                            Harvard University, and worked as a parliamentary reporter before completing his doctorate in 2012.
                            James researches the intersection of literary narrative with technological and political systems over 
                            the course of the twentieth century, and has particular interests in modernist studies, Cold War-era culture, 
                            and contemporary fiction. He wrote Modernist Informatics (OUP, 2016) to understand how the idea of 'information' was 
                            understood as an aesthetic concept in early C20th British writing; now he is interested mostly in how technology, science, 
                            policy, rhetoric, and imaginative writing interact in 1950s and 1960s Britain and the British Empire/Commonwealth.
